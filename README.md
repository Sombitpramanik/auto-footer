# Automatic Footer Using JavaScript

This project demonstrates a simple implementation of an automatic footer using JavaScript. The footer dynamically displays the current year and includes a copyright notice.

## Project Structure

- **index.html**: The main HTML file containing the structure of the webpage.
- **style.css**: The CSS file with styling for the footer.
- **script.js**: The JavaScript file that dynamically updates the current year in the footer.

## Usage

To use this code in your project:

1. Copy the content of `index.html` into your HTML file.
2. You may customize the styling in `style.css` according to your preferences.
3. Ensure that the JavaScript code in `script.js` is included in your project for dynamic year updating.

## HTML Structure

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <!-- Meta tags and title -->
    <!-- Styling with inline CSS -->
</head>
<body>
    <!-- Footer with a dynamic year -->
</body>
<script>
    // JavaScript code to update the current year
</script>
</html>
```

## Styling

The footer is styled using simple CSS rules to position it at the bottom of the page. You can customize the styling in the `<style>` tag according to your design preferences.

## JavaScript

The JavaScript code fetches the current year and updates the content of the span with the id "yer" to display a copyright notice with the current year.
